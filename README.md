## Extending Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Error-Corrected Finite Difference Energy Balance Modeling in 3D Hydraulic Fracture Propagation

This repository contains the **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-enhanced Finite Difference Method (FDM)** implementation for modeling **energy balance in hydraulic fracture propagation**. The study explores **1D, 2D, and 3D formulations** to improve numerical accuracy and computational efficiency in fracture simulations.


### Methodology
The PINN-enhanced FDM framework integrates physics constraints into deep learning models to correct numerical errors in finite difference approximations. The key steps include:

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulating fracture scenarios under varying pressure gradients, viscosity, and dimensions.
2. **Finite Difference Approximation**: Discretizing the energy balance equation for numerical solutions.
3. **PINN Training**: Learning correction terms using physics-informed loss functions.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy via **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **error reduction metrics**.

### Results
- **MSE Reduction**: 
  - **1D PINN**: 1.0179  
  - **2D PINN**: 0.3653 (Best performance)  
  - **3D PINN**: 0.7593  
- **Optimal Training Setup**: Batch size **128**, 3-layer network.
- **Computational Efficiency**: PINN reduces oscillatory behavior near fracture tips while maintaining stability.
